After finally finding the solution to my issue–<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: No serial data received.</code>–I decided to write this blog post about it. I’m going to explain how to set up some common thiry-party boards in Arduino IDE using Arch Linux, but the same process should apply for similar boards across different distributions.</p> <table id="boards"> <tr> <th>Board</th> <th>Package</th> <th>URL</th> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://www.keyestudio.com/products/keyestudio-esp32-plus-development-board-woroom-32-module-wifibluetooth-compatible-with-arduino">Keyestudio ESP32 PLUS Development Board</a></td> <td>esp32 by Espressif Systems</td> <td>https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json</td> </tr> <td><a href="https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html">Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32C3</a></td> <td>esp32 by Espressif Systems</td> <td>https://files.seeedstudio.com/arduino/package_seeeduino_boards_index.json</td> &lt;/tr&gt; <tr> <td><a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821">Adafruit Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266</a></td> <td>esp8266 by ESP8266 Community</td> <td>http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json</td> </tr> <tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://www.digikey.ie/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/3406/7034992">Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE</a></td> <td>Adafruit nRF52 by Adafruit</td> <td>https://adafruit.github.io/arduino-board-index/package_adafruit_index.json</td> </tr> &lt;/table&gt; <p><br/></p> In the `Board` column you will find the name of each board hyperlinked to the manufacturer's site. (Note that this is not the same URL that is included in the `URL` column, which I will address in a moment.) Once you have identified your board, you will need to open Arduino IDE and navigate to the `Boards Manager` (`Tools` &gt; `Board` &gt; `Boards Manager`). Then you can search for the appropriate package in the `Package` column for your board. Click `Install` and wait until the installation is complete. Finally, copy the corresponding URL from the `URL` column and open the `Preferences` menu (`File` &gt; `Preferences`), where you can paste the URL under `Additional boards manager URLs`. Now you should be all set to select your device and begin programming, which I explain in detail below. If your working with an original nRF52832 device like the `Adafruit Feather nRF52 Bluefruit LE`, you will likely need to update the bootloader. If you're using <i>Linux</i>, you will first need to install the `adafruit-nrfutil` package. The <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-adafruit-nrfutil">python-adafruit-nrfutil</a> package on the AUR worked fine for me, but there are also instructions on <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-adafruit-nrfutil">Adafruit</a>. I was then able to select `Tools` &gt; `Burn Bootloader`, which got my `Adafruit nRF52` running flawlessly. There are more details about this process on <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide/updating-the-bootloader">Adafruit</a> as well. <table id="boards"> <tr> <th>Group</th> <th>Entry</th> <th>Port</th> </tr> <tr> <td>esp32</td> <td>ESP32-WROOM-DA Module</td> <td>/dev/ttyUSB0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>esp32</td> <td>XIAO_ESP32C3</td> <td>/dev/ttyACM0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>esp8266</td> <td>Adafruit Feather HUZZAH ESP8266</td> <td>/dev/ttyUSB0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adafruit nRF52</td> <td>Adafruit Feather nRF52832</td> <td>/dev/ttyUSB0</td> </tr> </table> <p><br/></p> This table lists the information that you will need to select your board in Arduino IDE, and I've also included the port that I used (although yours might be different). Open `Tools` and hover over the `Board` option, where you will see the different packages that you have installed. Then refer to the `Group` and `Entry` column to select your board. If your device is plugged in, the port should have been selected automatically, but you can also select it manually under `Tools` &gt; `Port`. At this point, you should be all set get your board blinking ;) I hope that this helped!
