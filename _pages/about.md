Welcome! I'm Mark Van Kirk, a junior at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu). I currently reside in the smartest, strongest, and humblest dorm on campus, [Dillon Hall](https://www.residentiallife.nd.edu/undergraduate/halls/dillon-hall), while pursuing a major in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.nd.edu) and a minor in [Theology](https://www.theology.nd.edu).

This past summer, I stayed in South Bend to conduct research on in-memory architectures for recommendation systems and transformer networks. During the weekends, I had the chance to visit [Indiana Dunes National Park](https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm), go on the [Architecture River Tour](https://shorelinesightseeing.com/architecture-river-tour) in Chicago, and play countless board games at [Griffon Games and Bookstore](https://www.griffon-bookstore.com). I wrapped up the summer with a two-week adventure in [Glacier National Park](https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm) and [Banff National Park](https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/ab/banff) with my dad.

As you might have noticed, I really enjoy spending time in the outdoors and seeing the great things that nature has to offer. I particularly enjoy fly fishing, especially when I manage to catch [trout species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout#Species) in their native waters! When I'm not in the wilderness, I try to stay active through walking, swimming, and rock climbing. You're also likely to find me reading a [good book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3228917-outliers) in a cozy spot...
