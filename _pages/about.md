Welcome! I'm Mark Van Kirk, a senior at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu). I currently serve as a resident assistant in the smartest, strongest, and humblest dorm on campus, [Dillon Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dillon_Hall), while pursuing a major in Computer Science and a minor in Theology.

This past summer, I made my way to Ireland to conduct research on [electromagnetic side-channel attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_attack) at [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie). During the weekends, I had the chance to visit [Killarney](https://killarney.ie) and [Derry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derry), swim at the [Forty Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_Foot) on [Bloomsday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsday), and attend the [All-Ireland Quarterfinals](https://www.gaa.ie/football/gaa-football-all-ireland-senior-championship) in [Gaelic football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football).

In my free time, I like to venture outdoors to see the great things that nature has to offer! I particularly enjoy fly fishing, especially when I manage to catch [trout species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout#Species) in their native waters. I also appreciate sitting down at a table to play a good board game, such as [Nusfjord](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/234277/nusfjord) or [Yellow & Yangtze](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244114/yellow-and-yangtze).
